3. **Append file**: Prompts the user to enter the name of an existing file and appends the provided text at the end of the file.

4. **Renaming file**: Prompts the user to enter the current file name and the desired new file name, and renames the file accordingly.

5. **Deleting file**: Prompts the user to enter the name of a file to be deleted, and removes the file from the desktop.

6. **Copying file**: Prompts the user to enter the name of an existing file and the name of a new file, and creates a new file with the same content as the existing file.

7. **Encoding file**: Prompts the user to enter the name of a file and displays the encoding used for that file.
